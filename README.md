# Data Science Learning Journey Showcase

This repository showcases my learning journey in the field of data science, covering various topics such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository represents a specific topic or project, and it includes details, code, and insights from my exploration.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Pandas Basics:** Introduction to Pandas library with hands-on examples.
2. **NumPy Fundamentals:** Key concepts and functionalities of NumPy.
3. **Scikit-Learn Projects:** Real-world projects and case studies using Scikit-Learn for machine learning.
4. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preprocessing datasets.

## Datasets

The 'datasets' folder contains various datasets used in the notebooks. Each dataset is appropriately labeled, and you can explore them to understand the context of each project.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks locally, you need to set up a Conda environment using the provided `environment.yml` file:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate your_environment_name

After activating the environment, launch Jupyter Notebook:
