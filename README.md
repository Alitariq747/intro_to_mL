# Data Science Learning Journey Showcase

This repository showcases my learning journey in the field of data science, covering various topics such as Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-Learn. Each Jupyter Notebook in this repository represents a specific topic or project, and it includes details, code, and insights from my exploration.

## Notebooks Overview

1. **Pandas Basics:** Introduction to Pandas library with hands-on examples.
2. **MatplotLib Library** For pretty and detailed visualisations.
3. **NumPy Fundamentals:** Key concepts and functionalities of NumPy.
4. **Scikit-Learn Projects:** Real-world projects and case studies using Scikit-Learn for machine learning.
5. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Techniques for cleaning and preprocessing datasets.

## Datasets

The 'datasets' folder contains various datasets used in the notebooks. Each dataset is appropriately labeled, and you can explore them to understand the context of each project.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks locally, you need to set up a Conda environment after forking a local copy; which involves following steps:
 **Download Conda**
 **Activate Conda env** in the project directory involving packages: 
 * pandas
 * Numpy
 * MatplotLib
 * Jupyter Notebook -> make sure python version >= 3.10



After activating the environment, launch Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook
```
